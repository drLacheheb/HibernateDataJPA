# My First Spring Data JPA Project

This repository contains my first simple project using Spring Data JPA and Hibernate.

## Project Description

In this project, I have implemented a basic example of using Spring Data JPA with Hibernate. The main focus is on understanding how to set up entities, repositories, and perform CRUD operations using these technologies. Currently, the project consists solely of integration tests to validate CRUD functionalities.

## Running Tests

To run the tests in this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/drLacheheb/HibernateDataJPA.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd HibernateDataJPA
   ```

3. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvnw clean install
   ```

4. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   mvnw test
   ```

   This command will execute all the test cases in the project, most of which are integration tests.
